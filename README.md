# README
## SYNOPSIS

This is my first Ruby on Rails application. I follow the instructions from the book RAILS NOVICE TO NINJA 3d edition.
It is a bit outdated in 2023 and I have decided to use the current versions of Ruby and Rails. I can find all missing info online to complete the tasks. Besides, it is is all part of the learning process.
The app Readit is a similar application to the Reddit website.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
